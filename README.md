A facial expression recognition system based on CNN.


A CNN model for human facial expression recognition, using a B/S architecture and separated front and back ends to build a system for static human expression recognition. The main works accomplished are outlined as follows:
</br></br>• An optimized CNN model structure with several parameter settings improved from VGG-16 was introduced and used to train for the hybrid dataset in the experiment.
</br></br>• The image data in the FER+ and CK+ datasets were mixed and then categorized to obtain seven categories of expression classification, and the imbalanced data were pre-processed to minimize the influence of data imbalance on the training accuracy of the model. It was then used for model training. The blended data set had diverse samples and helped to achieve better performance for model training.
</br></br>• A static expression recognition system was built using a B/S architecture and separated the front-end and back-end. The detailed features and system operation process were then presented. Furthermore, the reliability and the accuracy of the model were tested. The images used for testing are all taken by a camera on the computer in a realistic context, ensuring that the system has a certain application potential.
